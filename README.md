# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks-in-Keras-
This recent practice project involved training a neural network with Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. After 10 epochs of training, the model achieved a test accuracy of 98.40%. To further analyze performance, both correct and incorrect predictions were visualized.
